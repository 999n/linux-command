# The `grep` command

The `grep` filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern.
grep stands for globally search for regular expression and print out. The pattern that is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression.

### Examples:

1. To search the contents of the destination.txt file for a string("KeY") case insensitively.

```
grep -i "KeY" destination.txt
```

2. Displaying the count of number of matches

```
grep -c "key" destination.txt
```

3. We can search multiple files and only display the files that contains the given string/pattern.

```
grep -l "key" destination1.txt destination2.txt destination3.xt destination4.txt
```

4. To show the line number of file with the line matched.

```
grep -n "key" destination.txt
```

5. If you want to grep the monitored log files, you can add the `--line-buffered` to search them in real time.

```
tail -f destination.txt | grep --line-buffered "key"
```

### Syntax:

The general syntax for the grep command is as follows:

```
grep [options] pattern [files]
```
