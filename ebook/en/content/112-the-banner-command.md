# The `banner` command

The `banner` command writes ASCII character Strings to standard output in large letters. Each line in the output can be up to 10 uppercase or lowercase characters in length. On output, all characters appear in uppercase, with the lowercase input characters appearing smaller than the uppercase input characters.

Note: If you will define more than one NUMBER with sleep command then this command will delay for the sum of the values.

### Examples :

1. To display a banner at the workstation, enter:

```
banner LINUX!
```


2. To display more than one word on a line, enclose the text in quotation marks, as follows:

```
banner "Intro to" Linux
```

> This displays Intro to on one line and Linux on the next


3. Printing “101LinuxCommands” in large letters.

```
banner 101LinuxCommands
```

> It will print only 101LinuxCo as banner has a default capacity of 10
